# ags-config

A very rough attempt at making ags configuration more nixified

## Why

Avoid the direct inclusion of hundreds of js and css files into my configuration
repository _and_ because flakes enable us to do this kind of structure trivially

## Credit

This repository utilises a majority of work originating from [https://github.com/Aylur/dotfiles/tree/main/ags](Aylur's dotfiles repository) -
huge thanks to them for the work they put into the ags project
